# Learning System Monitoring Guide

## Quick Status Check

Run this to see current status:
```bash
python3 monitor_learning_status.py
```

This shows:
- ✅ Is learning running?
- ✅ What adjustments have been made?
- ✅ Current performance metrics
- ✅ Data collection status

---

## Can You Stop the Script?

### If it's the Main Bot (`run.py` or `bot_cycle.py`):
**⚠️ DO NOT STOP** - This is your trading bot. Stopping it will:
- Stop trading
- Stop learning cycles
- Stop position monitoring
- Stop all updates

### If it's a Monitoring/Analysis Script:
**✅ Safe to stop** - These are read-only:
- `monitor_learning_status.py` - Safe to stop
- `verify_learning_and_performance.py` - Safe to stop
- `comprehensive_systems_audit.py` - Safe to stop
- `fix_learning_system.py` - Safe to stop (but let it finish first)

## How to See What Learning is Doing

### 1. Real-Time Monitor
```bash
python3 monitor_learning_status.py
```
Shows:
- Last learning cycle time
- Recent adjustments made
- Signal weight changes
- Performance trends

### 2. Check Learning Audit Log
```bash
tail -20 logs/learning_audit.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool
```
Shows recent learning cycle activity

### 3. Check Signal Weights
```bash
cat feature_store/signal_weights_gate.json | python3 -m json.tool
```
Shows current signal weights and when they were updated

### 4. Check Learning State
```bash
cat feature_store/learning_state.json | python3 -m json.tool
```
Shows pending adjustments and learning status

---

## What Changes Are Being Made?

### Signal Weight Changes
**Location:** `feature_store/signal_weights_gate.json`

**What it shows:**
- Current weights for each signal
- History of weight changes
- When weights were last updated
- Reasoning for changes

**Example:**
```json
{
  "weights": {
    "liquidation": 0.1013,
    "funding": 0.1007,
    "whale_flow": 0.1011
  },
  "updated_at": "2025-12-21T15:52:00",
  "history": [...]
}
```

### Learning Adjustments
**Location:** `feature_store/learning_state.json`

**What it shows:**
- Adjustments generated by learning cycles
- Whether adjustments have been applied
- Gate threshold changes
- Sizing multiplier changes

### Performance Trends
**Check:** Run `monitor_learning_status.py`

**What it shows:**
- Win rate trends (improving/declining)
- P&L trends (improving/declining)
- Recent vs historical performance

---

## Monitoring Schedule

### Every Hour (Optional)
```bash
python3 monitor_learning_status.py
```
Quick check to see if learning is active

### Daily
```bash
python3 verify_learning_and_performance.py
```
Comprehensive check of all systems

### Weekly
```bash
python3 comprehensive_systems_audit.py
```
Full system audit to catch issues

---

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs
- Learning audit log has recent entries
- Signal weights are updating
- Win rate is improving
- P&L is positive and increasing
- Adjustments are being applied

### ⚠️ Warning Signs
- Learning audit log empty for >24 hours
- Signal weights haven't changed in days
- Win rate declining
- P&L negative and getting worse
- No adjustments being generated

---

## Troubleshooting

### Learning Not Running?
```bash
python3 fix_learning_system.py
```

### No Adjustments Being Made?
- Check if you have enough data (need 50+ outcomes per signal)
- Check if learning cycles are completing
- Check learning audit log for errors

### Performance Not Improving?
- Check if adjustments are being applied
- Check if signal weights are updating
- Review recent trades for patterns
- Run comprehensive profitability analysis

---

## Next Steps

1. **Let the bot run** - Learning needs time to collect data
2. **Monitor daily** - Check `monitor_learning_status.py` daily
3. **Track trends** - Watch win rate and P&L over time
4. **Be patient** - Learning improvements take 1-2 weeks

**The bot is designed to continuously improve. Monitor it, but let it run and learn!**
